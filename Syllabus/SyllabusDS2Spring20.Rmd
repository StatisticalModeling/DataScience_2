### Course Description: {-}

**Introduction to Statistical Modeling**: Introduction to Statistical Modeling is a continuation of Introduction to Data Management and Visualization with an emphasis on statistical modeling and reproducible reporting using professional tools.  Hypothesis testing is introduced via resampling, and bootstrapping is used to introduce estimation.  Cross-validation is used to evaluate and select models that take into account the bias-variance trade-off.  Supervised learning techniques discussed will include but are not limited to linear regression, regression trees, classification trees, and random forests.
