The goal of this project is to create several different classification models and select the model that best predicts the response variable in a future data set the model has never seen.

1. Form a group of no fewer than two and no greater than four classmates.
2. Select one of the following data sets from the `modeldata` package:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DF <- data.frame(Data = c("credit_data", "attrition", "leaf_id_flavia", "mlc_churn", "taxi"),
             Predict = c("Status", "Attrition", "species", "churn", "tip"))
knitr::kable(DF)
```

3. Create at least three classification models using different specifications from the `parsnip` package.
4. Create `train` and `test` sets.
5. Use ten-fold cross-validation to tune all hyperparameters in your models.
6. Report appropriate metrics (AUC, accuracy, etc.) for your trained models.
7. Use the provided Quarto template as a start to creating a 6 to 10 minute presentation. Hide code you do not want to show during your presentation; but, make sure all the code you used to create the models is embedded in the slides.

  * Your presentation should include:
  
    a. The models you evaluated and their performance metrics on the **test** set.
    b. The steps you performed in your `recipe`.
    c. An evaluation of the time versus benefit of each modelâ€™s creation.
