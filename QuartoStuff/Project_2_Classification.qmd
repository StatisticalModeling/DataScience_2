1. Form a group of no less than two and no greater than four class-mates.
2. Select one of the following data sets from the `modeldata` package:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DF <- data.frame(Data = c("credit_data", "attrition", "leaf_id_flavia", "mlc_churn", "taxi"),
             Predict = c("Status", "Attrition", "species", "churn", "tip"))
knitr::kable(DF)
```

3. Create at least three classification models using different specifications from the `parsnip` package.
4. Create `train` and `test` sets.
5. Use ten-fold cross-validation to tune all hyperparameters in your models.
6. Report appropriate metrics (AUC, accuracy, etc.) for your trained models.
7. Use Quarto slides to create a 10 minute or less presentation - hide code you to not want to show during your presentation; but, make sure all code to create the models is in the slides.
