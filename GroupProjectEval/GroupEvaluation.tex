\centerline{\large\bo{Peer Evaluation Document}}

Group projects are sometimes looked upon as being ``unfair.''  Through the use of the partner evaluation, your perception of the quantity of work that you performed and that of your partner(s) is analyzed against the perceptions of your partner(s). Through this process, equity is more likely achieved. These evaluations are a serious statement and are used to re-distribute 40\% of the grade on the project. In order for this process to work effectively, there is the need for you to be honest and objective. Your ratings and comments are confidential and are deleted once the grades have been calculated.  This means that once the projects are graded and returned, grade distribution because of effort ratings will NOT be changed.  Typically, it is not wise to share your grade with others in the group, though those who have been rated as working less hard will often want to do so.

Evaluations (0-6 ratings of group members) must be e-mailed to me by by the date and time your project is due.  If you do not submit an evaluation, it will be assumed that you think everyone performed a fair share of the work, and grades will be awarded accordingly.
